'''
The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. 
Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

Assumption:

n>0 and m>0
Sum lies between integral range
Example

Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90
