Your task is to find and return the integer value representing how many times the ant reaches back to original starting position.
Note:
• Assume 1-based indexing
• Assume that the railing extends infinitely on the either sides
Input Format:
input1: An integer value N representing the number of moves made by the ant. 
input2 : An integer array A consisting of the ant's moves towards either side'''


n=int(input("enter a original number:"))
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
count=0
for i in range(n):
    if(sum(arr[:i+1])==0):
        count=count+1
print(count)
