Your task is to find and return an integer value, representing the maximum score.
Note:
Assume 1 based indexing
The elements on which operation has been performed cannot be selected again.
Input Specification:
Input1: An integer value N, representing the size of array A
input2: An integer array A
Output Specification:
Return an integer value, representing the maximum score
Sample Input:
4
1 2 3 4
SampleÂ Output:
4
